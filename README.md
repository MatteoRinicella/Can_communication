# Can_communication
STM32 Nucleo F401RE + MCP2515 &lt;-> Arduino mega 2560 + MCP2515 project for CAN bus communication, including ISO-TP reassembly and UDS diagnostic service demos.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Organization

The project is organized into **milestones (A, B, C, D)**.  
Each milestone contains smaller **sub-milestones**, focused on specific development goals (driver setup, protocol testing, UDS implementation, etc.).

- **Milestone A** â†’ Basic CAN setup & loopback tests  
- **Milestone B** â†’ ISO-TP segmentation/reassembly (currently in progress âœ…)  
- **Milestone C** â†’ UDS diagnostic service layer  
- **Milestone D** â†’ Final integration & robustness testing
